# Emerging-Technologies-Assessment

***

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks:
1. An overview of the scikit-learn Python library and a demonstration of three scikit-learn algorithms
2. An overview of Deutsch's algorithm and a comparision of quantum computing vs classical computing

## Quick Steps

You can view the scikit-learn notebook in static form by clicking the following image:
